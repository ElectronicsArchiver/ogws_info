### Coverage

This repository is only meant to cover structures from **RP Engine**.

<br>

### External Definitions

other external resources like `EGG` and `NW4R`, which are not defined here.

<br>

### Virtual Addresses

As this project is designed to help future decompilation, all specified <br>
`Virtual Addresses` reference the `US Rev 1` version of the game.

<br>

### Interest

*If you are interested in the decompilation or would* <br>
*like to contribute, feel free to check it out* ***[OGWS]*** *.*
